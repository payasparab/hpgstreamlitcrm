Notes: Informed her of Del Techs CNA admin program, put her in contact with Jillian to hopefully establish a relationship where clinicals can be done.  Informed her of Delaware Skills (new castle county).  
•	She expressed frustration in the hiring process because the applicants seem to not want the jobs they apply for.  She thinks that they apply because they are forced to by the state to keep getting unemployment benefits.  People resign in a matter of days.  She thinks that no person wants to work in this profession.  
•	Sent her a follow up email and questionnaire.
•	They are in dire need of CNA’s just finished the struggle with hiring LPN’s and RN’s but she says that that is also an ongoing issue with turnover.

•	Not currently hiring
•	Ususes all our training programs 
•	Pays for all employees training, del castle, Delaware skills, co-ops
•	Provides good pay and health care, work truck etc.
•	NO UNION
•	Word of mouth recruiting 
•	Wants DE to go to PA electrical model, eliminate barriers to entry for entry level electric al work.  Make it so you create a “electrical laborer position, not registered with DOL, and electrical board” They do this in PA, and he has guys in PA and DE, he can pay “untrained” guys 35 dollars an hour in PA.  We lose 4 Delawareans in his business alone to PA because of this rule.
•	DOL is radio silent on waving the 75-dollar application fee for Highschool Students to apply to become apprentices.  Only trade that does this! 
•	Take 1-2 months and around $200 just to turn a screw at an electrical site.  This is a major barrier to entry.  
•	Illegal mom and pop shops having employees work under the table or start early to avoid the BS.  
•	Major barrier to non-English speaking and learning-disabled folks who would like to get started in the trade.  Eliminating the requirement to be an official apprentice will free up large amounts of people to start the career and see if they like it.

•	They have a GREAT relationship with the Delaware Skills Center, 10-week program, knocks out their first year of apprenticeship.  
•	Starting 20$ hr, moves to 30 when you become a journeyman. 
•	Del techs HVAC program doesn’t have any cross over with the apprenticeship program… He is unsure why anyone would do this program.  It is even more expensive than the Delaware Skills center program that gives you a certification for your first full year of apprenticeship in just 10 weeks.  
•	Skills center needs to be expanded.  It is maxed out ever program.  If they had more people, they’d hire more people.
•	 RATIO: while ratio doesn’t affect them very much since they do mainly 1 to 1 jobs (residential).  It does hurt commercial jobs.  As a result of that guys on commercial sites aren’t getting their hours recorded towards their journeymen.  Creating a lack of journeymen in the hiring pool for residential employers.  It takes 5 years for them to grow a journeyman from the ground up.  
•	No luck or faith in DOL programs so far.  I gave him info on Elevate DE and he seemed very intrigued.  But DOL and DJL reputation is poor.  
•	Finds much more success in DE skills accelerated program over the co-op.  
•	Students coming out of dawn career institute were not good.

•	Always looking to expand and hire, (needs third shift night workers) 
•	$15.30hr starting pay for totally inexperienced people
•	$30hr for experienced knowledgeable (corrugated manufacturing trade people)
•	There is no training program in the state for this position it is all in house.
•	Their main objective is to poach employees from other manufacturers around the country.
•	Barriers to employment are (HIGH COST OF HOUSING) the rent prices are sky high, landlords wont rent unless you have a 700-credit score, every time you apply it hurts your credit school, so it is a vicious cycle.  (NO ACCESS TO CHILDCARE) Kent County receives less than new castle in compensation for childcare services.  This leads there to be fewer childcare operators since they cannot sustain a business in Kent County.  (Transportation) there is no bus route to or near the factory period.  At least 10 employees apparently walk to work or must use uber to get to work from Dover.  The facility is only 2 miles outside of the city.
•	They have over 150 applicants a month.  Finding people to apply isn’t hard its keeping them and having them stay due to the 3 major issues listed above.

a.	Overall great awareness of DOL services. Use bonding program for specific positions and DJL for all job postings. 
b.	Feels that training providers aren’t so relevant to construction industry as they are to the skilled trades, so doesn’t find training providers to be necessarily relevant to their business needs (heavy equipment operators, CDL drivers, etc.).
c.	Open to hearing about all relevant resources and training providers available within the state.
11.	General notes: 
a.	Construction hiring is cyclical – currently hiring for 7 positions, but it’s winter so a low period. 
b.	All employees have 90-day introductory period, gives them opportunity to train on the job 
i.	Look for ppl that have qualifications in certain areas prior to hiring and then do on the job training 
1.	Project managers, e.g., must have PMP & college ed to fill position, or safety director must have certain qualifications 
2.	Insurance requirements for drivers
3.	These are required by both DOL and insurance 
12.	 Use Indeed & DJL for positions 
13.	Most significant challenge in attracting talent is finding people that want to work – been that way since 2020, but construction doesn’t seem to be the type of work people are looking for – specific to many industries that require being present at work everyday 
14.	Specific roles aren’t more difficult to hire than others, and generally hiring isn’t too bad at Melvin Joseph. It’s just the general issues of “people don’t want to work” that everyone is feeling

-cannot qualify for Elevate DE since they have 3 seperate centers totally over 100 employees

Thinks that the wellfare system is what is causing the low end labor shortage... People get paid to stay at home and now work jobs like these.  The state needs to ensentive people to work not, not to work.  

- The industry is in a labor crisis.  There are no CDA certified candidates in the market place.  Once this becomes the standard it will greatly impact the number of people they can recruite from.  Previous TECE 1/2 canidates will not longer be able to teach in centers and have to go back for re-education. Doing this at a time when these centers can't find employees is counter productive.  

-Wants people with education degrees to be able to work/teach in Childcare Centers without CDA or TECE 1/2

- Wants the state to provide a tax credit to SIC W2 employees who work in the Childcare/ ECE field.  

- Has great disapointement with DOE employees office of early learning, john kline and kaley gleenson.

""no consequences for not working""
""entitlement programs are hurting the industry""

in order to pay what the teachers deserve the childcare facility will need to charge 500-600 a week per child as opposed to 200-300.  That is the only way wages can go up to what they need to be in intise people to work in this field.  The state hasn't raised their rates since 2021 and clearly everything has increased in cost since. Rent, labor, diapers, food, gas, insurance, etc.  Charging the same prices cannot continue.

He thinks most people are contracted within DE and not direct employees -- they subcontract their distribution mechanisms within the US. Manufacturing of their devices are currently in the UK and may be brought over to the US as soon as there is growth. 
Anticipated job growth is in sales -- always looking for new driven people; sales experience comes in handy, but it's more about willing to go to work. right now that's the biggest hurdle is finding people that want to go to work and do their job; with everyone going through covid, the lack of wanting to go back and be in person full time is a huge issue. Wasn't sure about DE programs and without information about DE employment status, none were mentioned. With main US market for this company being sales, there weren't major training gaps or needs that he could identify.

I am one of those.  I do not have the answers, but it is a growing problem.  I have been searching for over two years with no success.

 

There is an area the State can help.  If we hire someone with little experience and it doesn’t work out, the business suffers with unemployment claims issues and subsequent higher rates from the State.

Hiring is all done through HR for NCC,
Not having too much difficulty finding people to fill open positions.  Sometimes theres a misconception about what working in a libary is like (more physical that people expect)

Interesting perspective on people seaching for jobs (libarys are difacto, american job centers) many people 40 and older go to libaries and do not know how to use a computer.  They are trying to apply to jobs at Walmart Etc. however they cannot fill out the online applications.  They get frustrated and demand that the libary staff does it for them. ""they simply do not want to do the homework"" it takes to create a resume etc.
